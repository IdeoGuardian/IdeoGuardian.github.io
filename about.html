    <h1>About the IdeoGuardian Project</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Origins</h2>
        
        <p>The IdeoGuardian project emerged from interdisciplinary research at the intersection of digital humanities, information security, and cultural studies. It represents an effort to apply cybersecurity thinking to the protection of cultural narratives and identity integrity in digital environments.</p>
        
        <p>As our lives become increasingly digital, the protection of not just data but of narratives, cultural memory, and identity becomes critical. The IdeoGuardian framework addresses these challenges through a humanistic approach that prioritizes diversity, autonomy, and integrity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
        
        <p>The project is guided by several key philosophical principles:</p>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>1. Protection Without Control</h3>
            <p>Security approaches should enhance rather than restrict human expression and agency.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>2. Diversity as Strength</h3>
            <p>Multiple perspectives and cultural expressions create resilience against manipulation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>3. Education Over Restriction</h3>
            <p>Empowering individuals to recognize manipulation is more effective than centralized filtering.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>4. Balance Across Domains</h3>
            <p>Technical solutions must be balanced with cultural understanding and ethical considerations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>5. Evolution Through Dialogue</h3>
            <p>The framework should continuously evolve through engagement with diverse stakeholders.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        
        <p>The IdeoGuardian project is currently in a conceptual development phase, exploring both theoretical foundations and potential applications. The creative narrative "Decoding Eternity | 解碼永恆" represents an exploration of these concepts through fiction, while technical documentation outlines possible implementation approaches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Research Focus Areas</h2>
        
        <p>The project focuses on several key research questions:</p>
        
        <ul class="research-questions">
            <li>How can we identify narrative manipulation techniques across different cultural contexts?</li>
            <li>What principles should guide the development of protection systems that respect diversity and autonomy?</li>
            <li>How can technical systems and human judgment work together to protect narrative integrity?</li>
            <li>What educational approaches can enhance individual and collective resilience against manipulation?</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Collaboration Opportunities</h2>
        
        <p>The IdeoGuardian project welcomes collaboration with researchers, technologists, cultural practitioners, and policy experts interested in narrative protection and digital identity preservation. The interdisciplinary nature of these challenges requires diverse perspectives and expertise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Future Vision</h2>
        
        <p>The long-term vision for the IdeoGuardian framework is to develop principles, methodologies, and eventually tools that can help preserve narrative integrity and cultural diversity in increasingly complex digital environments.</p>
        
        <p>Rather than creating centralized arbiters of truth, the project aims to develop distributed approaches that empower individuals and communities to recognize manipulation while preserving the rich diversity of cultural expressions and interpretations.</p>
